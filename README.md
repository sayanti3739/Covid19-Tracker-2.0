# Covid19-Tracker-2.0 

An Android App that helps in keeping track of the total number of Corona-positive patients in **India** and **Globally**, i.e. total number of corona positive patients, total number of people that have recovered (or discharged) and total number of deaths (due to Corona) in India and in various countries around the world. 

The Indian stats are as declared by [The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/), using REST API (as mentioned below) .
* The API source for the app is : [https://api.rootnet.in/covid19-in/stats/latest](https://api.rootnet.in/covid19-in/stats/latest)
* The Github link (to the profile) for the above mentioned source : [https://github.com/amodm/api-covid19-in](https://github.com/amodm/api-covid19-in)

For the global stats:
* The API source for total global stats is : https://corona.lmao.ninja/all
* The API source for the global country-wise stats is : https://corona.lmao.ninja/countries

Just install the app-debug.apk file to install the app on your phone and keep track of the spread of Corona in India. {P.S. Don't worry about the security warnings that your phone might show (if any); that's only because the app is not available in Google Play Store}

**Enjoy!**
